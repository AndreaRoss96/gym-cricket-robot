CricketEnv:
 - riguarda il constructor, particularly hte action_space and observation_space --> in reset fai previous_action
 - @FATTO implement the step + reward function 
 - give a look to the method reset()
 - implmement (copia) render
 - implement (copia) close

Goal: --> suggerimento: guarda alle funzioni che ho scritto per finta nell'env
 - in order to compute the reward function, we need to implement tha class GOAL,
   which can be represented as another class Cricket (not environment) with a certain
   angle for the joints

Neural Networks:
 - need to implement both the actor and critic Networks
